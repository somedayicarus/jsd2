>> The Target of An Event is an Element <<
.. All Events Occur on an Element. The element that the event is acting on is called the Target. 

Event Listener 
	Listens for a certain type of event 
	Listens for that event to be dispatched 
	(aka occur) on a certain element

Remember: JavaScript is asynchronous - means that things occur at different times

Element.addEventListener("EventType", CallbackFunction) 
	eg: 
	h1.addEventListener("click", handleClickEvent);

Event.preventDefault()	- called on event

You can dispatch events manually, or the browser will dispatch the event based on the interaction with the page

The callback function is passed the Event Object as the 1st argument
