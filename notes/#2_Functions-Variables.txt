Control Flow

	The browser does 2 thins with your javascript
	1. Reads your code
		finds syntax errors // typos // hidden functions
		your code is read from top to bottom
		and from left to right
	2. Executes your code
		runs all code that is not in a function 
		top to bottom & left to right
		finds runtime (or execution) errors

Function 
	- group of code that is only run when called by name
	- has a name/identifier
	- can execute/run multiple times
	- takes inputs and has an output

P-arameters = P for "Placeholders" or "Parking spaces" // subtract(x, y)
A-rguments = A for "Actual" or "Automobile" // subtract(10, 7)

<---- Homework: Write 4 Functions that make calculations ---->
<------------------------------------------------------------>

Things you can do with a Function 
	1. Create (or Define) it:

		function functionName() {
			return x;
		};

	2. Call it:

		functionName();

	3. Reference: 

		functionName;

Things you can do with Variables
	1. Create:

		var variableName;
		var variableName = "This is a string"; 

		if unassigned, initial value = 'undefined'
		can be assigned a value:

	2. Use/Reference:

		var newVariable = variableName + " " + otherVariable


Same naming rules for both functions & variables 
	RULES
	- must start with letter (up or lc) or $ or _
	- remaining characters can be letters (up or lc), numbers, $, or _

	BEST PRACTICES
	- never use spaces in names
	- use lower camelCase
	- example: firstWordSecondWord
